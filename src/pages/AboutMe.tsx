// My name is Andrew Curtis. I'm graduating from the University of Louisiana with a degree in Computer Science (Cybersecurity)
// I've always been a computer nerd and continue to be one. 
// I'm a cat dad of two wonderful kitties.
// I'm a musician, mainly playing guitar, bass, and drums these days. But I know and occasionally continue to play piano and saxophone. 
// I'm working part time as a Technical Support Specialist at a local elementary/high school. 
// I sometimes like to tinker with small electronic components to learn the basics of how certain hardware works physically. 
// Recently, I've been getting very big into networking such as administration of my own network, and managing different kinds of servers.
// I am currently an Administrator of the official Element Animation Minecraft and Discord servers.
